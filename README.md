# keybr_analytics
A scalable analytics pipeline for processing and analyzing KeyBR typing data. This project converts raw KeyBR JSON exports into a structured local database, computes advanced typing metrics (WPM, accuracy, error rates, TTFE/TTKE, key-level stats, rolling averages), and generates clean CSV outputs for dashboards (e.g., Google Sheets).
